## Clustering
This notebook shows how to use baseline method in clustering. Especially, how to divide sets of points such that they 
are distant from different clusters but close to each other internally.

## Local Graph Partitioning
This notebook shows how to deal with local spectral clustering problem based on article: *"A Local Spectral Method for Graphs: With Applications to Improving
Graph Partitions and Exploring Data Graphs Locally" by Michael W. Mahoney, Lorenzo Orecchia, Nisheeth K. Vishnoi.*
